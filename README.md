# My Project

The project is created for the need to get a job and also to continue learning and digging into the problems we encounter in programming.
The aim of the project was to create a form which, depending on the options selected, displays the relevant fields to be entered
so that you can "create" a meal, finally data should be submitted via POST request as a JSON to
https://umzzcc503l.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dishes/ and the form should support returned validation errors (if any)."

The project was created using ReactJS, and the following libraries were installed:

npx create-react-app (project developed on this basis)
redux
react-redux
redux-form
axios

Below I show which versions of node.js and npm I have worked in:
node v16.17.0
npm v8.15.0
